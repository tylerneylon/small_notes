  <p>I recently enjoyed reading <em>So Good They Can’t Ignore You</em>
  by Cal Newport, a thought-provoking book that argues in favor of a
  specific perspective on your big-picture career mindset. This post
  summarizes and provides some analysis of it. Since I like to be kind
  to authors, I also encourage you to <a
  href="https://www.amazon.com/So-Good-They-Cant-Ignore-You-audiobook/dp/B009CMO8JQ/">buy
  the book</a> if it appeals to you.</p>
  <h1 data-number="1" id="summary"><span
  class="header-section-number">1</span> Summary</h1>
  <p>Cal’s goal is essentially to answer the question:</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p><strong>How should I plan my career?</strong></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><em>(I think it’s strange that we call authors by their last name
  in writing when we address people by first name in person. So I’m
  trying out referring to Cal as Cal instead of as “Newport,” which
  would sound overly-formal if I were speaking out loud.)</em></p>
  <p>He suggests these ideas as a framework for thinking about your
  career:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Don’t fall into the trap of following your passion as a first
  priority. <span class="gray"><em>(Ch 1–2)</em></span></li>
  <li>Build up career capital in the form of rare and valuable skills.
  <span class="gray"><em>(Ch 4–7)</em></span></li>
  <li>It’s nice to have control over what you do in your work.
  <ul>
  <li>Don’t opt for control until you have rare and valuable skills.
  <span class="gray"><em>(Ch 9–10)</em></span></li>
  <li>Do opt for control despite others wanting to be in charge of you.
  <span class="gray"><em>(Ch 11)</em></span></li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>It’s nice to have a career mission.
  <ul>
  <li>Don’t look for a mission before you have rare and valuable skills.
  <span class="gray"><em>(Ch 13)</em></span></li>
  <li>Once you have a mission, move toward it with bite-sized projects;
  “little bets.” <span class="gray"><em>(Ch 14)</em></span></li>
  <li>Once you have a mission, share your work in a way that makes
  people want to talk about it, and in a place that’s conducive to
  sharing and discussion. <span class="gray"><em>(Ch
  15)</em></span></li>
  </ul></li>
  </ul>
  <p>That’s the book in a nutshell.</p>
  <h2 data-number="1.1" id="book-origins"><span
  class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Book Origins</h2>
  <p>The book was published in 2012, just as Cal was about to begin his
  tenure-track position as a computer science professor at Georgetown.
  (Below I’ll go into more thoughts along the line of: He seems a bit
  early in his career to be giving career-length advice; for now I’ll
  focus on a more objective summary.) He had written a series of blog
  posts refuting the passion hypothesis — the mandate to follow your
  dreams — and they received a strong reception. He expanded on those
  ideas into this book. Along the way, he interviewed a number of
  interesting personalities, building his hypotheses on what worked or
  didn’t work for them.</p>
  <h2 data-number="1.2" id="cals-writing-since-2012"><span
  class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Cal’s Writing Since 2012</h2>
  <p>I was curious if Cal had evolved his thinking since publishing this
  book. He was early in his career, and the book lands to me a little as
  a hypothesis, rather than as a tested theory, for Cal himself. I would
  have found value in Cal saying either “yep, this has worked out great
  for me,” or perhaps “golly, I think I should revise some of those
  hypotheses.” However, I didn’t find evidence either way. (If you’re a
  skeptical person, you might read as subtle evidence the hypotheses
  could use some revision).</p>
  <p>After 2012, Cal has written several books focusing on productivity
  and reducing distractions. For example, he doesn’t like that email is
  used as a default means of communication where we expect quick
  replies. Instead, he advocates seeing email as asynchronous — no quick
  replies are expected — and promotes ideas such as office hours as
  designated times when someone <em>is</em> expected to respond right
  away. I think he’s seeing the need for daily tactics after having
  deeply considered life-scale strategy.</p>
  <h1 data-number="2" id="analysis"><span
  class="header-section-number">2</span> Analysis</h1>
  <p>I take basically everything with a grain of salt, and this book is
  no exception. I’m going to agree with ideas when they make sense to me
  and match my experience. While I’m about to include criticism of the
  book, note that I found it good enough to read and to write about.</p>
  <p>To some degree, the ideas presented here make intuitive sense.
  Nothing Cal says seems to be overtly mistaken. For example, I have
  often noticed a feeling of boredom or even unhappiness when I’m about
  to begin certain work projects, only to be surprised at how many
  interesting ideas could arise in the course of working on the project.
  I’ve often seen excitement show up as the <em>result</em> of hard
  work, not as the precursor.</p>
  <p>At the same time, this book follows a common formula. Cal presents
  an abstract idea up front, tells one or two stories that support this
  idea, and then summarizes the idea again. Each chapter feels like
  this, and the book as a whole follows a similar arc. I have to admit
  that I was satisfied when Cal returned to the same story he opened
  with, of a man who followed his passion to become a monk, but was
  miserable as a result. That man left his life of disconnection and
  returned to the rat race, and was happier.</p>
  <p>I have a few problems with this formula, which is common among
  advice books:</p>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>It’s one-sided.</strong> Cal presents his ideas as in an
  opinion piece, trying to convince us the ideas are rock-solid. This is
  quite different from the tone of an impartial expository writer
  showing us multiple perspectives.</li>
  <li><strong>It presents anecdotes as strong evidence.</strong> I’m
  skeptical about the reliability of anecdotes as arguments. While Cal
  lands as credible, this genre is rife with writing that I suspect
  embelishes or creates supporting stories.</li>
  <li><strong>It’s redundant.</strong> I was sometimes bored re-reading
  the same ideas repeatedly.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Ok, that’s somewhat harsh — apologies to Cal if you read this. I
  aim to be more critical of the genre than of this particular author. I
  love to read math books, which tend to be the polar opposite in terms
  of information density.</p>
  <p>Having complained about the genre, let’s get into the content: Are
  the ideas themselves useful?</p>
  <h2 data-number="2.1" id="idea-passion-is-not-a-first-priority"><span
  class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Idea: Passion is not a first
  priority</h2>
  <p>This one is easy for me to agree with. I appreciate that Cal later
  clarifies that passion is not <em>bad</em> so much as it should not be
  your <em>primary</em> motivation. I agree with this because I have
  many interests, and I could just as easily enjoy solving KenKen
  puzzles as I do researching consciousness-achieving algorithms, and
  one of those has more career value than the other. This idea also
  resonates with some well-respected career advice from Richard Hamming,
  who always wants people to work on the most important problem they can
  make progress on; this is another example of passion being subserviant
  to the value of your work.</p>
  <h2 data-number="2.2"
  id="idea-first-create-rare-and-valuable-skills"><span
  class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Idea: First create rare and
  valuable skills</h2>
  <p>There’s not much to disagree with here. I tried to think of careers
  in which the primary measure of job skill was simply how long you’ve
  been in the job. Any job like that would not be a good match for this
  advice. All I can think of, however, are unexciting government or
  unionized positions. And in both cases, I’m not sure how externally
  impressive such a career would be. In other words, I have trouble
  thinking of any counterexamples at all to the premise that a
  fulfilling career is built on rare and valuable skills.</p>
  <h2 data-number="2.3"
  id="idea-carefully-bid-for-control-over-your-work"><span
  class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Idea: Carefully bid for
  control over your work</h2>
  <p>I mostly agree with this premise, although Cal positioned his
  stories to suggest that you’ll always have to fight for control in
  your job. That’s not always true. I’ve worked for people who have
  trusted me not because I insisted on autonomy but because I deliver
  good work, and giving me autonomy was better for them than
  micromanaging me. I’ve felt similarly about people I’ve managed —
  people who thrive with more control — and voluntarily gave them more
  independence rather than waiting for them to request it. If anything,
  I’d say that friction against autonomy tells you something about your
  employer, rather than always indicating you’ve attained a certain
  threshold of value.</p>
  <h2 data-number="2.4"
  id="idea-carefully-choose-a-mission-for-your-work"><span
  class="header-section-number">2.4</span> Idea: Carefully choose a
  mission for your work</h2>
  <p>This is the most nebulous of Cal’s ideas in the books, and was the
  least satisfying for me to think about. Should I feel bad if I don’t
  have a mission and I’m far into my career? What if I chose a mission
  but later changed direction? What if I’m already happy without a
  mission?</p>
  <p>I suspect this part of Cal’s thinking is likely influenced by his
  pursuit of an academic career. If you’re a musician, for example, you
  may simply want to make good music. Perhaps there’s an analogue of a
  mission for musicians, such as nudging a musical trend in a direction
  you like, or perhaps raising awareness of a cause you care about. But
  it would be a lie to pretend that you write music <em>because</em> of
  an external cause, such as world hunger.</p>
  <p>A mission can augment a sense of meaning in your career. It’s not
  critical to have one. If you care about something and want to make a
  difference in the world, go for it — but you can be happy without
  heroism.</p>
  <h2 data-number="2.5" id="a-point-of-comparison"><span
  class="header-section-number">2.5</span> A point of comparison</h2>
  <p>In 2006, Paul Graham published an essay called <a
  href="http://www.paulgraham.com/love.html"><em>How to do what you
  love</em></a>.</p>
  <p>I think Paul is a compelling writer. So compelling, in fact, that I
  put more than my usual effort into thinking critically about what he
  writes. Paul’s essay on doing what you love presents ideas similar to
  the passion hypothesis — the idea that you should follow your
  passions.</p>
  <p>It’s more nuanced than that, however. I think what Paul really
  expresses is that society imposes on us a false dichotomy between work
  and play. He also argues that, if you want to be happy, loving what
  you do has to be part of it. The difference between this and the
  passion hypothesis is that Paul (I believe) agrees with Cal that it’s
  difficult to find something fulfilling that you love to do, and that
  it’s worth dedicated, up-front effort to find that match.</p>
  <p>Paul points out, for example, that if a person strays from the
  beaten path, that might indicate either that they’re lazy (bad), or
  that they’re working to be productive in an independent way (good).
  But it’s hard to tell the difference. On diagnosing your own
  path-straying behavior, he says:</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>Is there some test you can use to keep yourself honest? One is to
  try to do a good job at whatever you’re doing, even if you don’t like
  it. Then at least you’ll know you’re not using dissatisfaction as an
  excuse for being lazy. Perhaps more importantly, you’ll get into the
  habit of doing things well.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>I recommend reading the full essay to have another perspective on
  career questions that overlap with Cal’s book. Where the ideas don’t
  quite line up, it’s educational to perform a merge conflict in your
  mind.</p>
  <h2 data-number="2.6" id="whats-left-out"><span
  class="header-section-number">2.6</span> What’s left out?</h2>
  <p>Although Cal does not explicitly say this, the tone of the book
  presents itself as a guide to happiness in terms of making large-scale
  career decisions. Yet the book feels like it’s reacting to common
  mistakes rather than giving us a full career playbook. Or, if I’m
  being pessimistic, the writing comes across as someone who’s good at
  publicity taking advantage of a few sticky ideas to sell a book (it’s
  not purely that, but the mood feels salesy at times).</p>
  <p>There are many factors that contribute to career happiness. Here
  are few important ones that Cal doesn’t talk much about:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Positive impact on the world.</li>
  <li>Work-life balance.</li>
  <li>Compensation.</li>
  <li>Good relationships with your colleagues.</li>
  <li>Learning and feeling challenged.</li>
  <li>Safety.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Cal does briefly mention the value of career <em>impact</em> and
  <em>relatedness</em> — work relationships — but doesn’t say much about
  them.</p>
  <p>Here’s an example of something not covered by the book: I’ve worked
  for a number of startups, and it’s quite common to feel a great deal
  of pressure to work nights and weekends for startups. This can easily
  cause burnout, lack of sleep, and other kinds of unhappiness. There
  seem to be various resource metrics (think: sleep tank, energy tank,
  social tank) that need to be maintained for happiness. These resources
  are not going to be fully addressed even if we have a great framework
  for thinking about passion, mission, and career capital.</p>
  <p>To be fair, Cal doesn’t explicitly say he’ll address all aspects of
  finding happiness in your job. At the same time, the book’s tone lands
  as if it has everything figured out. I’d love to read more books that
  present interesting ideas a style that reads as succinct and
  inquistive without overconfidence.</p>
