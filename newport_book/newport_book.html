  <p>I recently enjoyed reading the book <em>So Good They Can’t Ignore
  You</em> by Cal Newport. This post summarizes the book and provides
  some analysis of it. Since I like to be kind to authors, I also
  encourage you to <a
  href="https://www.amazon.com/So-Good-They-Cant-Ignore-You-audiobook/dp/B009CMO8JQ/">buy
  the book</a> if it appeals to you.</p>
  <h1 data-number="1" id="summary"><span
  class="header-section-number">1</span> Summary</h1>
  <p>Cal’s goal is essentially to answer the question: How should I plan
  my career?</p>
  <p><em>(I think it’s strange that we call authors by their last name
  in writing when we address people by first name in person. So I’m
  trying out referring to Cal as Cal instead of as “Newport,” which
  would sound stiff and overly-formal if I were to speak that way out
  loud.)</em></p>
  <p>He suggests these ideas as a framework for thinking about your
  career:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Don’t fall into the trap of following your passion as a first
  priority. <em>(Chapters 1–2)</em></li>
  <li>Build up career capital in the form of rare and valuable skills.
  <em>(Chapters 4–7)</em></li>
  <li>It’s nice to have control over what you do in your work.
  <ul>
  <li>Don’t opt for control until you have rare and valuable skills.
  <em>(Chapters 9–10)</em></li>
  <li>Do opt for control despite others wanting to be in charge of you.
  <em>(Chapter 11)</em></li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>It’s nice to have a career mission.
  <ul>
  <li>Don’t look for a mission before you have rare and valuable skills.
  <em>(Chapter 13)</em></li>
  <li>Once you have a mission, move toward it with bite-sized projects;
  “little bets.” <em>(Chapter 14)</em></li>
  <li>Once you have a mission, share your work in a way that makes
  people want to talk about it, and in a place that’s conducive to
  sharing and discussion. <em>(Chapter 15)</em></li>
  </ul></li>
  </ul>
  <p>That’s the book in a nutshell.</p>
  <h2 data-number="1.1" id="book-origins"><span
  class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Book Origins</h2>
  <p>The book was published in 2012, just as Cal was about to begin his
  tenure-track position as a computer science professor at Georgetown.
  (Below I’ll go into more thoughts along the line of: He seems a bit
  early in his career to be giving career-length advice; for now I’ll
  focus on a more objective summary.) He had written a series of blog
  posts refuting the passion hypothesis — the mandate to follow your
  dreams — and they received a strong reception. He expanded on those
  ideas into this book. Along the way, he interviewed a number of
  interesting personalities, building his hypotheses on what worked or
  didn’t work for them.</p>
  <h2 data-number="1.2" id="cals-writings-since-2012"><span
  class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Cal’s Writings Since
  2012</h2>
  <p>I was curious if Cal had evolved his thinking since publishing this
  book. He was early in his career, and the book lands to me a little as
  a hypothesis, rather than as a tested theory, especially for Cal
  himself. I would have found value in Cal saying either “yep, this has
  worked out great for me,” or perhaps “golly, I think I should revise
  some of those hypotheses.” However, I didn’t find evidence either way
  (which, if you’re a skeptical person, you might read as subtle
  evidence the hypotheses could use some revision).</p>
  <p>After 2012, Cal has written several books focusing on productivity
  and reducing distractions. For example, he doesn’t like the way email
  is often used as a default means of communication, and one for which
  we sometimes expect quick replies. Instead, he advocates for
  considering email to by asynchronous — no quick replies are expected —
  and suggests ideas like office hours, as designated times when someone
  is expected to respond right away. I interpret this follow-up as Cal
  seeing the need for hour-to-hour systems in improving his career
  experience.</p>
  <h1 data-number="2" id="analysis"><span
  class="header-section-number">2</span> Analysis</h1>
  <p>I take basically everything with a grain of salt, and this book is
  no exception. I’m going to agree with ideas when they make sense to me
  and match my experience.</p>
  <p>To some degree, the ideas presented here make intuitive sense.
  Nothing Cal says seems to be overtly mistaken. For example, I have
  often noticed a feeling of boredom or even unhappiness when I’m about
  to begin certain work projects, only to be surprised at how many
  interesting ideas could arise in the course of working on the project.
  I’ve often seen excitement show up as the <em>result</em> of hard
  work, not as the precursor.</p>
  <p>At the same time, this book follows a common formula. Cal presents
  an abstract idea up front, tells one or two stories that support this
  idea, and then summarizes the idea again. Each chapter feels like
  this, and the book as a whole follows a similar arc. I have to admit
  that I was satisfied when Cal returned to the same story he opened
  with, of a man who followed his passion to become a monk, but was
  miserable as a result. That man left his life of disconnection and
  returned to the rat race, and was happier.</p>
  <p>I have a few problems with this formula:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>It’s one-sided. Cal presents his ideas as in an opinion piece,
  trying to convince us the ideas are rock-solid, as opposed to the
  writing of an impartial expository writer showing us multiple
  perspectives.</li>
  <li>It presents anecdotes as if they were strong scientific evidence.
  I’m skeptical about the reliability of anecdotes as arguments. While
  Cal lands as credible, this genre is rife with writing that I suspect
  embelishes or creates supporting stories.</li>
  <li>It’s redundant. I was sometimes bored re-reading the same ideas
  repeatedly.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Ok, that’s somewhat harsh — apologies to Cal if you read this. I
  aim to be more critical of the genre than of this particular
  author.</p>
  <p>Having complained about the genre, let’s get into the content: Are
  the ideas themselves useful?</p>
  <h2 data-number="2.1" id="idea-passion-is-not-a-first-priority"><span
  class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Idea: Passion is not a first
  priority</h2>
  <p>This one is easy for me to agree with. I appreciate that Cal later
  clarifies that passion is not <em>bad</em> so much as it should not be
  your <em>primary</em> motivation. I agree with this because I have
  many interests, and I could just as easily enjoy solving KenKen
  puzzles as I do researching consciousness-achieving algorithms, and
  one of those has more career value than the other. This idea also
  resonates with some well-respected career advice from Richard Hamming,
  who always wants people to work on the most important problem they can
  make progress on; this is another example of passion being subserviant
  to the value of your work.</p>
  <h2 data-number="2.2"
  id="idea-first-create-rare-and-valuable-skills"><span
  class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Idea: First create rare and
  valuable skills</h2>
  <p>There’s not much to disagree with here. I tried to think of careers
  in which the primary measure of job skill was simply how long you’ve
  been in the job. Any job like that would not be a good match for this
  advice. All I can think of, however, are unexciting government or
  unionized positions. And in both cases, I’m not sure how externally
  impressive such a career would be. In other words, I have trouble
  thinking of any counterexamples at all to the premise that a career is
  built on rare and valuable skills.</p>
  <h2 data-number="2.3"
  id="idea-carefully-bid-for-control-over-your-work"><span
  class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Idea: Carefully bid for
  control over your work</h2>
  <p>I mostly agree with this premise, although Cal positioned his
  stories to suggest that you’ll always have to fight for control in
  your job. I don’t think that’s always true. I’ve worked for people who
  have trusted me not because I insisted on autonomy but because I
  deliver good work, and giving me autonomy was easier for them than
  micromanaging me. I’ve also been a manager of people where I felt the
  same way, and voluntarily gave them more autonomy, rather than waiting
  for them to request it. If anything, I’d say that how much friction
  there is tells you more about your employer than about yourself.</p>
  <h2 data-number="2.4"
  id="idea-carefully-choose-a-mission-for-your-work"><span
  class="header-section-number">2.4</span> Idea: Carefully choose a
  mission for your work</h2>
  <p>This is the most nebulous of Cal’s ideas in the books, and was the
  least satisfying for me to think about. Should I feel bad if I don’t
  have a mission and I’m far into my career? Or what if I chose a
  mission but later changed direction? What if I’m already happy without
  a mission?</p>
  <p>I suspect this part of Cal’s thinking is likely influenced by his
  pursuit of an academic career. If you’re a musician, for example, you
  may simply want to make good music. Perhaps there is an analogue of a
  mission, such as moving a trend in a direction you feel is better, or
  perhaps raising awareness of a cause you care about. But it would be a
  lie to pretend that you write music <em>because</em> of an external
  cause, such as world hunger.</p>
  <p>What I’m getting at is that I suspect the idea of a mission is
  something that can clarify or augment a sense of meaning in your
  career, but is not critically necessary. If you care about something,
  and want to make a difference in the world, go for it. But that simple
  desire-and-response need not be presented in the light of a career
  necessity.</p>
  <h2 data-number="2.5" id="whats-left-out"><span
  class="header-section-number">2.5</span> What’s left out?</h2>
  <p>Although Cal does not explicitly say this, the tone of the book
  presents it as a guide to happiness in terms of making large-scale
  career decisions. I completely agree that building rare and valuable
  skills is a critical low-level goal.</p>
  <p>At the same time, the book lands to me as more a response to some
  career mistakes than as a holistic overview of career planning. Or, if
  I’m being even more honest, the book lands to me as someone who’s good
  at publicity taking full advantage of a few small ideas to sell a book
  (sorry again, Cal!)</p>
  <p>There are many factors that contribute to career happiness. Here
  are few important ones that Cal doesn’t talk much about:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>The positive impact on the world of your work.</li>
  <li>Work-life balance.</li>
  <li>Compensation.</li>
  <li>Good relationships with your colleagues.</li>
  <li>Learning and feeling challenged.</li>
  <li>Safety.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>(Cal does briefly mention the value of career <em>impact</em> and
  <em>relatedness</em> — work relationships — but doesn’t say much about
  them.)</p>
  <p>To be fair, Cal doesn’t explicitly say he’ll address all aspects of
  finding happiness in your job. At the same time, the book’s tone lands
  as if it has everything figured out. I’d love to read more books that
  present an interesting set of ideas in a style that’s more succinct,
  introspective, and with an honest assessment of those ideas existing
  within a larger ecosystem of questions and complexities.</p>
