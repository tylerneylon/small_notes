I recently enjoyed reading the book *So Good They Can't Ignore You*
by Cal Newport, a thought-provoking book that argues in favor of a specific
perspective on your big-picture career mindset.
This post summarizes the book and provides some analysis of it.
Since I like to
be kind to authors, I also encourage you to
[buy the book](https://www.amazon.com/So-Good-They-Cant-Ignore-You-audiobook/dp/B009CMO8JQ/)
if it appeals to you.

# Summary

Cal's goal is essentially to answer the question: How should I plan my career?

*(I think it's strange that we call authors by their last name in writing when
we address people by first name in person. So I'm trying out referring to Cal as
Cal instead of as "Newport," which would sound stiff and overly-formal if I
were to speak that way out loud.)*

He suggests these ideas as a framework for thinking about your career:

* Don't fall into the trap of following your passion as a first priority.
  *(Chapters 1--2)*
* Build up career capital in the form of rare and valuable skills.
  *(Chapters 4--7)*
* It's nice to have control over what you do in your work.
  - Don't opt for control until you have rare and valuable skills.
    *(Chapters 9--10)*
  - Do opt for control despite others wanting to be in charge of you.
    *(Chapter 11)*
* It's nice to have a career mission.
  - Don't look for a mission before you have rare and valuable skills.
    *(Chapter 13)*
  - Once you have a mission, move toward it with bite-sized projects;
    "little bets."
    *(Chapter 14)*
  - Once you have a mission, share your work in a way that makes people want to
    talk about it, and in a place that's conducive to sharing and discussion.
    *(Chapter 15)*

That's the book in a nutshell.

## Book Origins

The book was published in 2012, just as Cal was about to begin his tenure-track
position as a computer science professor at Georgetown. (Below I'll go into more
thoughts along the line of: He seems a bit early in his career to be giving
career-length advice; for now I'll focus on a more objective summary.) He had
written a series of blog posts refuting the passion hypothesis --- the mandate
to follow your dreams --- and they received a strong reception. He expanded on
those ideas into this book. Along the way, he interviewed a number of
interesting personalities, building his hypotheses on what worked or didn't work
for them.

## Cal's Writings Since 2012

I was curious if Cal had evolved his thinking since publishing this book. He was
early in his career, and the book lands to me a little as a hypothesis, rather
than as a tested theory, for Cal himself. I would have found value in
Cal saying either "yep, this has worked out great for me," or perhaps "golly, I
think I should revise some of those hypotheses." However, I didn't find evidence
either way. (If you're a skeptical person, you might read as subtle
evidence the hypotheses could use some revision).

After 2012, Cal has written several books focusing on productivity and reducing
distractions. For example, he doesn't like the way email is often used as a
default means of communication, and one for which we sometimes expect quick
replies. Instead, he advocates for considering email to be asynchronous --- no
quick replies are expected --- and suggests ideas like office hours, as
designated times when someone is expected to respond right away.
I think he's seeing the need for daily tactics after having thought a lot about
life-scale strategy.

# Analysis

I take basically everything with a grain of salt, and this book is no exception.
I'm going to agree with ideas when they make sense to me and match my
experience. While I'm about to include criticism of the book, note that I found
it good enough to read and to write about.

To some degree, the ideas presented here make intuitive sense. Nothing Cal says
seems to be overtly mistaken. For example, I have often noticed a feeling of
boredom or even unhappiness when I'm about to begin certain work projects, only
to be surprised at how many interesting ideas could arise in the course of
working on the project. I've often seen excitement show up as the *result*
of hard work, not as the precursor.

At the same time, this book follows a common formula. Cal presents an abstract
idea up front, tells one or two stories that support this idea, and then
summarizes the idea again. Each chapter feels like this, and the book as a whole
follows a similar arc. I have to admit that I was satisfied when Cal returned to
the same story he opened with, of a man who followed his passion to become a
monk, but was miserable as a result. That man left his life of disconnection and
returned to the rat race, and was happier.

I have a few problems with this formula, which is common among advice books:

* It's one-sided. Cal presents his ideas as in an opinion piece, trying to
  convince us the ideas are rock-solid, as opposed to the writing of an
  impartial expository writer showing us multiple perspectives.
* It presents anecdotes as if they were strong scientific evidence.
  I'm skeptical about the reliability of anecdotes as arguments. While
  Cal lands as credible, this genre is rife with writing that I suspect
  embelishes or creates supporting stories.
* It's redundant. I was sometimes bored re-reading the same ideas repeatedly.

Ok, that's somewhat harsh --- apologies to Cal if you read this. I aim to be
more critical of the genre than of this particular author. I love to read math
books, which a bit of a polar opposite in terms of information density.

Having complained about the genre, let's get into the content: Are the ideas
themselves useful?

## Idea: Passion is not a first priority

This one is easy for me to agree with. I appreciate that Cal later clarifies
that passion is not *bad* so much as it should not be your *primary* motivation.
I agree with this because I have many interests, and I could just as easily
enjoy solving KenKen puzzles as I do researching consciousness-achieving
algorithms, and one of those has more career value than the other. This idea
also resonates with some well-respected career advice from Richard Hamming, who
always wants people to work on the most important problem they can make progress
on; this is another example of passion being subserviant to the value of your
work.

## Idea: First create rare and valuable skills

There's not much to disagree with here.
I tried to think of careers in which the primary measure of job skill
was simply how long you've been in the job. Any job like that
would not be a good match for this advice.
All I can think of, however, are unexciting government or
unionized positions. And in both cases, I'm not sure how
externally impressive such a career would be. In other words,
I have trouble thinking of any counterexamples at all to
the premise that a career is built on rare and valuable skills.

## Idea: Carefully bid for control over your work

I mostly agree with this premise, although Cal positioned
his stories to suggest that you'll always have to fight for
control in your job. I don't think that's always true. I've
worked for people who have trusted me not because I insisted on
autonomy but because I deliver good work, and giving me autonomy
was easier for them than micromanaging me. I've also been
a manager of people where I felt the same way, and voluntarily
gave them more autonomy, rather than waiting for them to
request it. If anything, I'd say that how much friction there is
tells you more about your employer than about yourself.

## Idea: Carefully choose a mission for your work

This is the most nebulous of Cal's ideas in the books, and was
the least satisfying for me to think about. Should I feel bad
if I don't have a mission and I'm far into my career? What
if I chose a mission but later changed direction? What if I'm
already happy without a mission?

I suspect this part of Cal's thinking is likely influenced by
his pursuit of an academic career. If you're a musician, for
example, you may simply want to make good music. Perhaps there
is an analogue of a mission for musicians, such as nudging a musical
trend in a direction
you feel is better, or perhaps raising awareness of a cause you
care about. But it would be a lie to pretend that you write
music *because* of an external cause, such as world hunger.

I think a mission
is something that can augment a sense of meaning
in your career, but isn't critical.
If you care about something and want to make a difference in
the world, go for it. But that desire-and-response
need not be presented in the light of a career necessity.

## A point of comparison

In 2006, Paul Graham published an essay called
[*How to do what you love*](http://www.paulgraham.com/love.html).

I think Paul is a compelling writer. So compelling, in fact, that
I put more than my usual effort into thinking critically about what
he writes. Paul's essay on doing what you love presents ideas similar to the
passion hypothesis --- the idea that you should follow your passions.

It's more nuanced than that, however. I think what Paul really expresses is that
society imposes on us a false dichotomy between work and play. He also argues
that, if you want to be happy, loving what you do has to be part of it. The
difference between this and the passion hypothesis is that Paul (I believe)
agrees with Cal that it's difficult to find something fulfilling that you love
to do, and that it's worth dedicated thought to look for that match.

Paul points out, for example, that if a person strays from the beaten path,
they could be either lazy (bad) or working to be productive in an independent
way (good). But it's hard to tell the difference. He says:

> Is there some test you can use to keep yourself honest? One is to try to do
> a good job at whatever you're doing, even if you don't like it. Then at least
> you'll know you're not using dissatisfaction as an excuse for being lazy.
> Perhaps more importantly, you'll get into the habit of doing things well.

I recommend reading the full essay to have different perspectives on similar
ideas that you can merge conflict in your mind.

## What's left out?

Although Cal does not explicitly say this, the tone of the
book presents itself as a guide to happiness in terms of making
large-scale career decisions. I completely agree that building
rare and valuable skills is a critical foundational goal.

Yet the book feels like it's reacting to common mistakes rather
than giving us a full career playbook.
Or, if I'm being pessimistic, the writing comes across
as someone who's good at publicity taking
advantage of a few sticky ideas to sell a book (it's not purely that,
but the mood feels salesy at times).

There are many factors that contribute to career happiness.
Here are few important ones that Cal doesn't talk much about:

* The positive impact on the world of your work.
* Work-life balance.
* Compensation.
* Good relationships with your colleagues.
* Learning and feeling challenged.
* Safety.

Cal does briefly mention the value of career *impact* and *relatedness* ---
work relationships --- but doesn't say much about them.

As one example that wouldn't be covered by this book: I've worked for a number
of startups, and it's quite common to feel a great deal of pressure to work
nights and weekends for startups. This can easily cause burnout, lack of sleep,
and other kinds of unhappiness. There seems to be various tanks (think: sleep
tank, energy tank, social tank) that need to be maintained for happiness. These
resources are not going to be fully addressed even if we have a great framework
for thinking about passion, mission, and career capital.

To be fair, Cal doesn't explicitly say he'll address all aspects of finding
happiness in your job.
At the same time, the book's tone lands as if it has everything figured out.
I'd love to read more books that present an interesting set of ideas
in a style that's more succinct, introspective, and with an honest assessment of
those ideas
existing within a larger ecosystem of questions and complexities.
