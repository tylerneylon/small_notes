# small_notes

This is a place for me to record shorter pieces of writing for my homepage.

The idea is that, for each post, I'll create a directory. I generally compile
posts from markdown files into both html and pdf using pandoc; the `toboth`
script in each directory handles this compilation.
Finished posts are published at
[tylerneylon.com](https://tylerneylon.com/).
